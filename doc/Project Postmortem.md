# Project Postmortem
>  Assessing the process used during pre-product

# What went well?
* Communication on Slack was on point and the planning involved in each Sprint. When tasks were completed, each teammate made it aware to everyone else what was done.
* In-person meetings increased overall efficiency. We were able to work out issues faster when we were together.
* Finished tasks on time or in advance, which made development smoother.
* People were willing to step up to the plate and put a little extra effort to make sure deliverables were done well.

# What would we do more/less of?

* Meet more in person and online. This clearly made our overall production speed faster.
* Check other teammates stand-up replies and be more active in Slack. Some issues could have been addressed faster if we read those.
* Do more code reviews in GitHub to help people with features they have trouble with.
* Do better with merging features. We wasted a lot of time fixing merge conflicts. The time could have been used for other means.
* Do more team sessions with Git so that knowledge transfer would be less of an issue.

# What would we change entirely?

* Code structure could be changed in accordance with feedback from Professor Austin for being able to network our game in the future easily for which we may have to have a TDD (Technical design doc).
* Add more comments in the code where changes were made to let others know and help merge.
* Have a rehearsal before the presentation. This can boost both confidence and efficiency.
* With more time, we could have formalized our process more and added certain things such as strict coding standard adherence.

# What would we add?
* Make timeout to do in person weekly updates and personal thoughts.
* Add brainstorming sessions every two weeks to expand on features as the game’s feasibility has been verified by current prototype.
* Add more meeting time to keep development going well.
* Add postmortem maybe every two weeks to review our process and ensure it works well.
* Make more use of retrospectives and actively monitor any action plans that come out of them.
